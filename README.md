# remote-shell
c++ program that you can use to control other devices. The victim just has to open the client.exe and it will copy itself to the startup folder and run.
Only works on windows.

# building
run the command inside "build_client.txt" and run it to build the client.
You need "libgcc_s_seh-1.dll", "libstdc++-6.dll" and "libwinpthread-1.dll" in the same folder.

do the same thing with "build_server.txt" and the server.
